The LQTestCase is an abstract superclass to all LQTests. It implements the setUp-method to reset all global states before each test to ensure their independence from each other.
Not that running the tests in your local image will therefore also reset all global states of your Liquid, e.g. deleting all polls when the PollRepo default is reset.
