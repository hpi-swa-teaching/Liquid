A collection of tests concerning themselves with everything related to LQLocalObjectRepos.
This superclass implements tests that should be tested on both LocalObjectRepos and RemoteRepoClients. All tests implemented here will also be performed by LQRemoteRepoClientTests.
To test general functionality of the LQObjectRepo, implement tests in LQRemoteRepoClientTests to avoid duplicate execution.
