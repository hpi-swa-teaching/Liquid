LQGroupExclusionMarker detects choices in a collection of choices from which a user is excluded.

It is responsible for marking excluded choices in an choice list given to it as collection of LQChoices and returning them as a collection of either Strings (unmarked) or Texts (marked).
The group from which the user is excluded and the choicelist have to be given to this class when it is created.
The class also provides whether the user is excluded from a specific choice.
